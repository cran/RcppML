#' @title Non-negative least squares
#'
#' @description Solves the equation \code{a %*% x = b} for \code{x} subject to \eqn{x > 0}.
#'
#' @details 
#' This is a very fast implementation of non-negative least squares (NNLS), suitable for very small or very large systems.
#'
#' **Algorithm**. Sequential coordinate descent (CD) is at the core of this implementation, and requires an initialization of \eqn{x}. There are two supported methods for initialization of \eqn{x}:
#' 1. **Zero-filled initialization** when \code{fast_nnls = FALSE} and \code{cd_maxit > 0}. This is generally very efficient for well-conditioned and small systems.
#' 2. **Approximation with FAST** when \code{fast_nnls = TRUE}. Forward active set tuning (FAST), described below, finds an approximate active set using unconstrained least squares solutions found by Cholesky decomposition and substitution. To use only FAST approximation, set \code{cd_maxit = 0}.
#'
#' \code{a} must be symmetric positive definite if FAST NNLS is used, but this is not checked.
#'
#' See our BioRXiv manuscript (references) for benchmarking against Lawson-Hanson NNLS and for a more technical introduction to these methods.
#' 
#' **Coordinate Descent NNLS**. Least squares by **sequential coordinate descent** is used to ensure the solution returned is exact. This algorithm was 
#' introduced by Franc et al. (2005), and our implementation is a vectorized and optimized rendition of that found in the NNLM R package by Xihui Lin (2020).
#' 
#' **FAST NNLS.** Forward active set tuning (FAST) is an exact or near-exact NNLS approximation initialized by an unconstrained 
#' least squares solution. Negative values in this unconstrained solution are set to zero (the "active set"), and all 
#' other values are added  to a "feasible set". An unconstrained least squares solution is then solved for the 
#' "feasible set", any negative values in the resulting solution are set to zero, and the process is repeated until 
#' the feasible set solution is strictly positive. 
#' 
#' The FAST algorithm has a definite convergence guarantee because the 
#' feasible set will either converge or become smaller with each iteration. The result is generally exact or nearly 
#' exact for small well-conditioned systems (< 50 variables) within 2 iterations and thus sets up coordinate
#' descent for very rapid convergence. The FAST method is similar to the first phase of the so-called "TNT-NN" algorithm (Myre et al., 2017), 
#' but the latter half of that method relies heavily on heuristics to refine the approximate active set, which we avoid by using 
#' coordinate descent instead.
