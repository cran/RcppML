#' @description Spectral biparitioning by rank-2 matrix factorization
#'
#' @details
#' Spectral bipartitioning is a popular subroutine in divisive clustering. The sign of the difference between sample loadings in factors of a rank-2 matrix factorization
#' gives a bipartition that is nearly identical to an SVD.
#' 
#' Rank-2 matrix factorization by alternating least squares is faster than rank-2-truncated SVD (i.e. _irlba_).
#'
#' This function is a specialization of rank-2 \code{\link{nmf}} with support for factorization of only a subset of samples, and with additional calculations on the factorization model relevant to bipartitioning. See \code{\link{nmf}} for details regarding rank-2 factorization.
#'
#' @inheritParams nmf
#' @param samples samples to include in bipartition, numbered from 1 to \code{ncol(A)}. Default is \code{NULL} for all samples.
#' @param calc_dist calculate the relative cosine distance of samples within a cluster to either cluster centroid. If \code{TRUE}, centers for clusters will also be calculated.
#' @return
#' A list giving the bipartition and useful statistics:
#' 	\itemize{
#'    \item v       : vector giving difference between sample loadings between factors in a rank-2 factorization
#'    \item dist    : relative cosine distance of samples within a cluster to centroids of assigned vs. not-assigned cluster
#'    \item size1   : number of samples in first cluster (positive loadings in 'v')
#'    \item size2   : number of samples in second cluster (negative loadings in 'v')
#'    \item samples1: indices of samples in first cluster
#'    \item samples2: indices of samples in second cluster
#'    \item center1 : mean feature loadings across samples in first cluster
#'    \item center2 : mean feature loadings across samples in second cluster
