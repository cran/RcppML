\title{Get the number of threads RcppML should use}
\usage{
getRcppMLthreads()
}
\value{
integer giving number of threads to be used by RcppML functions. \code{0} corresponds to all available threads, as determined by OpenMP.
}
\description{
Get the number of threads that will be used by RcppML functions supporting parallelization with OpenMP. Use \code{\link{setRcppMLthreads}} to set the number of threads to be used.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# set serial configuration
setRcppMLthreads(1)
getRcppMLthreads()

# restore default parallel configuration, 
# letting OpenMP decide how many threads to use
setRcppMLthreads(0)
getRcppMLthreads()
