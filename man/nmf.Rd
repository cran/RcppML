\description{
Sparse matrix factorization of the form \eqn{A = wdh} by alternating least squares with optional non-negativity constraints.
}
\details{
This fast non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) implementation decomposes a matrix \eqn{A} into lower-rank
non-negative matrices \eqn{w} and \eqn{h}, with factors scaled to sum to 1 via multiplication by a diagonal, \eqn{d}: \deqn{A = wdh}

The scaling diagonal enables symmetric factorization, convex L1 regularization, and consistent factor scalings regardless of random initialization.

The factorization model is randomly initialized, and \eqn{w} and \eqn{h} are updated alternately using least squares.
Given \eqn{A} and \eqn{w}, \eqn{h} is updated according to the equation: \deqn{w^Twh = wA_j}

This equation is in the form \eqn{ax = b} where \eqn{a = w^Tw}, \eqn{x = h}, and \eqn{b = wA_j} for all columns \eqn{j} in \eqn{A}.

The corresponding update for \eqn{w} is \deqn{hh^Tw = hA^T_j}

\strong{Stopping criteria.} Alternating least squares projections (see \code{\link{project}} subroutine) are repeated until a stopping criteria is satisfied, which is either a maximum number of
iterations or a tolerance based on the correlation distance between models (\eqn{1 - cor(w_i, w_{i-1})}) across consecutive iterations. Use the \code{tol} parameter to control the stopping criteria for alternating updates:
\itemize{
\item \code{tol = 1e-2} is appropriate for approximate mean squared error determination and coarse cross-validation, useful for rank determination.
\item \code{tol = 1e-3} to \code{1e-4} are suitable for rapid expermentation, cross-validation, and preliminary analysis.
\item \code{tol = 1e-5} and smaller for publication-quality runs
\item \code{tol = 1e-10} and smaller for robust factorizations at or near machine-precision
}

\strong{Parallelization.} Least squares projections in factorizations of rank-3 and greater are parallelized using the number of threads set by \code{\link{setRcppMLthreads}}.
By default, all available threads are used, see \code{\link{getRcppMLthreads}}.
The overhead of parallization is too great to benefit rank-1 and rank-2 factorization.

\strong{Specializations.} There are specializations for symmetric matrices, and for rank-1 and rank-2 factorization.

\strong{L1 regularization}. L1 penalization increases the sparsity of factors, but does not change the information content of the model
or the relative contributions of the leading coefficients in each factor to the model. L1 regularization only slightly increases the error of a model.
L1 penalization should be used to aid interpretability. Penalty values should range from 0 to 1, where 1 gives complete sparsity. In this implementation of NMF,
a scaling diagonal ensures that the L1 penalty is equally applied across all factors regardless of random initialization and the distribution of the model.
Many other implementations of matrix factorization claim to apply L1, but the magnitude of the penalty is at the mercy of the random distribution and
more significantly affects factors with lower overall contribution to the model. L1 regularization of rank-1 and rank-2 factorizations has no effect.

\strong{Rank-2 factorization.} When \eqn{k = 2}, a very fast optimized algorithm is used. Two-variable least squares solutions to the problem \eqn{ax = b} are found by direct substitution:
\deqn{x_1 = \frac{a_{22}b_1 - a_{12}b_2}{a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}^2}}
\deqn{x_2 = \frac{a_{11}b_2 - a_{12}b_1}{a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}^2}}

In the above equations, the denominator is constant and thus needs to be calculated only once. Additionally, if non-negativity constraints are to be imposed,
if \eqn{x_1 < 0} then \eqn{x_1 = 0} and \eqn{x_2 = \frac{b_1}{a_{11}}}.
Similarly, if \eqn{x_2 < 0} then \eqn{x_2 = 0} and \eqn{x_1 = \frac{b_2}{a_{22}}}.

Rank-2 NMF is useful for bipartitioning, and is a subroutine in \code{\link{bipartition}}, where the sign of the difference between sample loadings
in both factors gives the partitioning.

\strong{Rank-1 factorization.} Rank-1 factorization by alternating least squares gives vectors equivalent to the first singular vectors in an SVD. It is a normalization of the data to a middle point,
and may be useful for ordering samples based on the most significant axis of variation (i.e. pseudotime trajectories). Diagonal scaling guarantees consistent linear
scaling of the factor across random restarts.

\strong{Random seed and reproducibility.} Results of a rank-1 and rank-2 factorizations should be reproducible regardless of random seed. For higher-rank models,
results across random restarts should, in theory, be comparable at very high tolerances (i.e. machine precision for \emph{double}, corresponding to about \code{tol = 1e-10}). However, to guarantee
reproducibility without such low tolerances, set the \code{seed} argument. Note that \code{set.seed()} will not work. Only random initialization is supported, as other methods
incur unnecessary overhead and sometimes trap updates into local minima.

\strong{Rank determination.} This function does not attempt to provide a method for rank determination. Like any clustering algorithm or dimensional reduction,
finding the optimal rank can be subjective. An easy way to
estimate rank uses the "elbow method", where the inflection point on a plot of Mean Squared Error loss (MSE) vs. rank
gives a good idea of the rank at which most of the signal has been captured in the model. Unfortunately, this inflection point
is not often as obvious for NMF as it is for SVD or PCA.

k-fold cross-validation is a better method. Missing value of imputation has previously been proposed, but is arguably no less subjective
than test-training splits and requires computationally slower factorization updates using missing values, which are not supported here.

\strong{Symmetric factorization.} Special optimization for symmetric matrices is automatically applied. Specifically, alternating updates of \code{w} and \code{h}
require transposition of \code{A}, but \code{A == t(A)} when \code{A} is symmetric, thus no up-front transposition is performed.

\strong{Zero-masking}. When zeros in a data structure can be regarded as "missing", \code{mask_zeros = TRUE} may be set. However, this requires a slower
algorithm, and tolerances will fluctuate more dramatically.
