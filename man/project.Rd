\title{Project a linear factor model}
\usage{
project(A, w = NULL, h = NULL, nonneg = TRUE, L1 = 0, mask_zeros = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{matrix of features-by-samples in dense or sparse format (preferred classes are "matrix" or "Matrix::dgCMatrix", respectively). Prefer sparse storage when more than half of all values are zero.}

\item{w}{dense matrix of factors x features giving the linear model to be projected (if \code{h = NULL})}

\item{h}{dense matrix of factors x samples giving the linear model to be projected (if \code{w = NULL})}

\item{nonneg}{enforce non-negativity}

\item{L1}{L1/LASSO penalty to be applied. No scaling is performed. See details.}

\item{mask_zeros}{handle zeros as missing values, available only when \code{A} is sparse}
}
\value{
matrix \eqn{h} or \eqn{w}
}
\description{
Solves the equation \eqn{A = wh} for either \eqn{h} or \eqn{w} given either \eqn{w} or \eqn{h} and \eqn{A}
}
\details{
For the classical alternating least squares matrix factorization update problem \eqn{A = wh}, the updates
(or projection) of \eqn{h} is given by the equation: \deqn{w^Twh = wA_j}
which is in the form \eqn{ax = b} where \eqn{a = w^Tw} \eqn{x = h} and \eqn{b = wA_j} for all columns \eqn{j} in \eqn{A}.

Given \eqn{A}, \code{project} can solve for either \eqn{w} or \eqn{h} given the other:
\itemize{
\item When given \eqn{A} and \eqn{w}, \eqn{h} is found using a highly efficient parallelization scheme.
\item When given \eqn{A} and \eqn{h}, \eqn{w} is found without transposition of \eqn{A} (as would be the case in traditional block-pivoting matrix factorization) by accumulating the right-hand sides of linear systems in-place in \eqn{A}, then solving the systems. Note that \eqn{w} may also be found by inputting the transpose of \eqn{A} and \eqn{h} in place of \eqn{w}, (i.e. \code{A = t(A), w = h, h = NULL}). However, for most applications, the cost of a single projection in-place is less than transposition of \eqn{A}. However, for matrix factorization, it is desirable to transpose \eqn{A} if possible because many projections are needed.
}

\strong{Parallelization.} Least squares projections in factorizations of rank-3 and greater are parallelized using the number of threads set by \code{\link{setRcppMLthreads}}.
By default, all available threads are used, see \code{\link{getRcppMLthreads}}. The overhead of parallization is too great for rank-1 and -2 factorization.

\strong{L1 Regularization.} Any L1 penalty is subtracted from \eqn{b} and should generally be scaled to \code{max(b)}, where \eqn{b = WA_j} for all columns \eqn{j} in \eqn{A}. An easy way to properly scale an L1 penalty is to normalize all columns in \eqn{w} to sum to 1. No scaling is applied in this function. Such scaling guarantees that \code{L1 = 1} gives a completely sparse solution.

\strong{Specializations.} There are specializations for symmetric input matrices, and for rank-1 and rank-2 projections. See documentation for \code{\link{nmf}} for theoretical details and guidance.
